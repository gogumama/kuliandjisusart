				Maybe it is not a surprise that I ended up this way<br>
				<br>
				That I became this way<br>
				<br>
				Maybe this is who I was supposed to be<br>
				<br>
				Maybe when I was in my mother's stomach, I was the same way<br>
				<br>
				Maybe then when I was very small and my organs, my arms, my little legs, my eyes, ears, my mouth, were all still forming, I was still curious about how the world works,but I was scared to go out and confront it. So I stayed inside, and thought thought maybe I could just take on the world from the inside. Maybe I was still too small. Wait, are we still talking about me in the mother's womb?<br>
				<br>
				You know how it feels like in there? Who remembers how they felt like inside there?<br>
				<br>
				Was it like being submerged in water, but somehow you could breathe? Was it like being in a jelly dream? Did it ever get dry? Did the baby fetus ever get thirsty?<br>
				<br>
				I sometimes wonder if I miss being in the womb, do I miss it even without knowing?<br>
				<br>
				That's called oblivious nostalgia<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				What about right now? I am big enough.<br>
				Big enough for what?<br>
				Big enough to be who I am supposed to be<br>
				Who are you supposed to be,<br>
				I am supposed to be who I am<br>
				Who are you?<br>
				You mean my name?<br>
				Yes, and everything else, what makes you you?<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				I am so big, so big that I can touch the clouds,<br>
				Look, it's right there.<br>
				I can go many places around the world, and see what's like there.<br>
				If it's dangerous, I can help make it less dangerous.<br>
