	<p>today i smiled
	</p>
	<pre> 7.11.25


Today I was sad,

 but there’s no need to pay no  mind. 

I am sad every day every day 

And everyday I smile, too

I guess 

It’s always a regular day 

But the sadness feel more pronounced 
They feel 
that they are more part of me than the smiles 

The sadness are the ones I show less, I never show them more 

I think it healthier, well Everyone agrees that it’s healthier and everyone practices that it’s healthier to smile,
 to show the teeth and all, 
more than the sadness, more than the cries 
I do that too, 

Even tho I don’t smile more in pictures, I do show smiles, I dot show the opposite of sadness. 

Oh Since this is a diary, i guess, I can say, yes, 
sadness is a creeping thing that 

every day tries to overtake 

my identity

My inside identity 



sadness takes over when dark my eyes are open

When dreams are nowhere to be found 

and no one is in sight  



but that’s OK, I’m used to that. 

I think the problem becomes then when



 Am in a room full of people  


Yet 


I feel invisible

I feel 
like I got a repellent potion, smelling all over me 

Am the cause, 
I
I put on the potion lotion 
 I put on the potion. I thought it was a sent. 
No , Apparently it was not. 
I have no way to verify this, or to confirm this by the eyes of people. 
Or by the results of my sadness and loneliness, 

maybe the potion is not working 

Maybe the stinky face people make upon seeing me 

Maybe they are the result of looking at me 
And seeing all the reclusion 

Am the cause of all this 




So then sadness takes a really powerful,

powerful stance against the smiles

Even in the moments when I get the courage to go out 
and be among the people 

I am still sad. 




I went out today 

as I do try to go out every week 
at least some point 

Because if I stay inside the whole time 
The sadness, it’s even 10 times fold, 

so people do help 
but

 I guess I should ask myself what am I really searching for 

something ?

someone ?

Yeah, of course I’m searching for someone, everyone is searching for someone. 

Someone that is already there 
someone they never seen 

Whatever, 

We are social beings,
We only exist because someone found someone else 

it’s hard to play by yourself 

all that and all that and all that !

but why, whatever I have is not enough? 

Am I missing something? 

Or Am not satisfied? or am too greedy, to spoiled. 

The funny thing is, I
 I think the thing is, am 

Am good at isolation 
Am good at dwelling in isolation 

I tend to feel like it suits me, 
A lot of the time it suits me, 

It works out 
But Sometimes it doesn’t 

And when it doesnt 
Yeah I make an effort to go out to the crowd 
then see what’s going on and when I step into the crowd, I get shy, I don’t. Approach anyone, and it let’s off a sticky stinky smell 
And, am repellent 
At I hope talking about it 
helps me solve it.
